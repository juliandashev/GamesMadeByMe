Lost: 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This was my introduction to the game dev world.
When I was developing the game at the time I was heavily influences by Studio MDHR's game "Cuphead".
It was something different and i wanted to expand my knowledge and skills by making similliar game.

When I show it to my teacher (advisor) in high school she suggested to model it into somthing more educational and compete in NOIT
In the game the main character is struggling with math and aims to defeat each boss that is facing him (More like me and math at the time :D))

Of 22 people, I went in 9th place

Survie in History:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This was my second attempt at developing a game, but this time I was working at a group (me and a classmate)

This game has the same motive that Lost has, but with the difference that it is about History
The main character is faced with different levels and different Boss fights where if his life points go to zero the game is restarted.
Of cource it would be unfair just to take from the player and not have some sort of reward system and that's why when defetead there's a chance for continuing the game
by answering a question about Bulgarian history. Even defeating a level the player is rewarded 3 questions to up his life points, each question harder than the previous.

We again won 9th place, but this time it came with getting accepted at Plovdiv University "Paisii Hilendarski"
